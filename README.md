# The House Of LambdaXymox

This is the repository for my personal website. It uses MyST Markdown tooling and python.

## Getting Started

Set up a local virtual environment with 

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

then activate the environment

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

then update `pip`

```bash
pip install -U pip
```

then install dependencies

```bash
pip install mystmd jupyter sympy numpy
```

and you're done.
